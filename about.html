                     India of 2020 as a country has various advantages compared to past few decades. India is almost a Non starter whether it comes to Wafer fab manufacturing, Assembly/Testing or in IC Packaging etc. Why there is such an unfair treatment by the domestic industries and MNC’s when investing and setting up Electronics Manufacturing plants in India. What can be done to undo the past to build up the present and the future with respect to Electronics Manufacturing?. Indian Government recently has come up with new set of incentives to kick start and boost Electronics Manufacturing in India.

                    India needs to break this ice by overcoming this old narrative and enter into this extremely critical area
                    of semiconductor manufacturing. The implication of electronic manufacturing expands from critical
                    areas like medical instrument manufacturing, Telecom instruments manufacturing, defense
                    manufacturing, Power equipment manufacturing, to manufacturing of solar cells etc. India needs to not only start semiconductor manufacturing but needs to ramp up to a stage where it becomes self-sufficient. Infact, it needs to ramp up manufacturing so that it starts to export like the way India have been able to achieve in automobile or pharmaceutical industry. India thus shall not only create new jobs but also create more secondary jobs leading to growth of the economy. India shall be able to conserve valuable forex reserves, create new jobs, overcome hardware security threats and try to become self-reliant from foreign manufactured electronics goods.

                    If India does not make a disruptive change now, the world would continue to dump electronics goods which would just increase with time. Even the futuristic consumer goods based on Electronics like the Electric cars, 5G Equipment’s, IOT’s devices etc. would be detrimental to our country’s growth, security, jobs creation and foreign exchange reserves if India continues to import such goods. The present and future generation of Engineers, Scientist, Technicians and people of India at large can’t further afford to lose on jobs, foreign exchange reserves, and economic growth. India also can’t emulate the U.S. or other developed country model as Indian currency does not have the privilege of being a Reserve Currency. It’s time to capitalize on the new Incentives given by the government to kick start Electronics manufacturing in India in a big way.

Parthsarthi was the first vice-chancellor. The objective
                            of the founders was to make the university a premier institution of higher learning and to promote research and teaching leading to the increasing engagement of its students and teachers in higher level academic work and national
                            and international policy making.
