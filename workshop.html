                India of 2020 as a country has various advantages :

                    <li>India is the 6th largest in terms of Manufacturing.</li>

                    <li>India ranks 3rd in producing refereed Scientific and Technical articles.</li>

                    <li>India has the 5th largest foreign exchange reserves (half a Trillion) which is almost 1/6 of our GDP.</li>

                	BUT in terms of Electronics Manufacturing India has a long way to go particularly in Wafer fab based chip manufacturing, Assembly/Testing or in IC Packaging. What can be done to undo the past and build up the present/future with respect to Electronics Manufacturing in India?. Indian Government recently has come up with new set of incentives to kick start and boost Electronics Manufacturing in India.
There is an age old narrative which has been fed to us Indians particularly in terms of Electronics manufacturing in India. This unfair narrative finds excuses like on EODB ranking, WTO agreement, Land/Labour reforms, need of Heavy Investments, Infrastructure, R&D etc. as to why India was deprived of investment by MNC in terms of Electronics manufacturing. On the other hand MNC’s invested heavily in the other developing economies like Mexico, Malaysia, Vietnam etc. and made such developing countries a part of their global electronics manufacturing eco-system (supply chain). India, facing similar challenges in the past has excelled in attracting investment by MNCs in other sectors of manufacturing like automobiles or pharmaceuticals. 
India needs to break this ice by overcoming this old narrative and enter into this extremely critical area of electronics/semiconductor manufacturing. The implication of electronic manufacturing expands from critical areas like medical instruments, Telecom instruments, Defense, Power equipment’s, to solar cells. India needs to ramp up its electronic manufacturing to a stage where it can become not only self-sufficient but can produce surplus to export like in the case of automobile or pharmaceutical industry. India thus shall not only create new jobs but also create more secondary jobs leading to growth of our economy. India shall be able to conserve valuable forex reserves, create new jobs, overcome hardware security threats and try to become self-reliant from foreign manufactured Electronics goods.

If India does not make a disruptive change now, the world would continue to dump electronics goods which would only increase with time as Futuristic consumer goods are Electronics based like the Electric Vehicles, 5G Equipment’s, IOT’s devices etc. This would be detrimental to our country’s growth, security, jobs creation and would severely affect our foreign exchange reserves. The present and future generation of Engineers, Scientist, Technicians and people of India at large can’t afford to maintain the status quo. It’s time to capitalize on the new Incentives given by the government to kick start Electronics manufacturing in India in a big way. The goal of this workshop is to spread awareness about the global Electronics manufacturing supply chain, Government of India New incentives and how through Education, Training and R& D one can “Make India an Electronics Manufacturing Hub”.
